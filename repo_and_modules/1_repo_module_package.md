/*
Module &
Packages
Go code is grouped into packages, and packages are grouped into
modules.
A module specifies the dependencies needed to run our code, including
the Go version and the set of other modules it requires in the go.mod
file

A collection of Go source code becomes a module when thereâ€™s a
valid go.mod file in its root directory.
It consists of the module declaration, the minimum compatible version
for Go, and the dependencies for the imported third-party packages.

$ go mod tidy ( when importing any third party package, running this lists in go.mod file and downloads the package)
